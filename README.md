**Simple Web Application with MongoDB using External Configuration**

## Project Description

This project is a straightforward web application that utilizes MongoDB as its database. It employs an external configuration approach for database connection details, utilizing Kubernetes ConfigMaps for configuration and secrets for sensitive credentials.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Kubernetes (for ConfigMaps and Secrets)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the web application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JeffreyOmoakah/Kubernetes-project.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Set up the external configuration by creating ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes.

3. Build and deploy the application in your Kubernetes cluster.

4. Access the web application by visiting its URL.

## Usage

This Node.js web application serves as a basic example. You can easily customize and extend its functionality by modifying the code to meet your project's specific requirements. The external configuration approach allows you to keep sensitive data secure and separate from your code.

Key components include:

- **app/index.js**: The main Node.js application file.
- **k8s/configmap.yaml**: Kubernetes ConfigMap for configuration.
- **k8s/secret.yaml**: Kubernetes Secret for sensitive credentials.
- **Dockerfile**: The Dockerfile used to containerize the application.

## MongoDB Configuration

Ensure that you provide the necessary MongoDB connection details within your ConfigMap and Secret. This allows the application to connect to your MongoDB database securely.

## Acknowledgments

This project leverages the power of Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets to maintain an externalized configuration and secure sensitive data. It was created with inspiration from various open-source projects and online tutorials.
